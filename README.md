# Tonncade

A musical hexagonal arcade game played on Euler's *Tonnetz* — a hexagonal lattice of consonant musical intervals. Placing, moving, and rotating pieces behaves both as a spatial geometry puzzle **and** a music sequencer. 

Inspired by classic grid-based arcade games.

Built in pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 SVG, and Web Audio API, the game runs completely client-side and can be run locally via a `file://` URL (no server or build steps needed) or installed as a standalone offline mobile app.

## Core Concept
Euler's Tonnetz organizes notes by harmonic relationships rather than scalar steps. In this pointy-top hexagonal representation:
*   **Horizontal Axis ($p$):** Perfect Fifths (+7 semitones)
*   **Diagonal Up-Right Axis ($q$):** Minor Thirds (+3 semitones)
*   **Resulting Diagonal Axis:** Major Thirds (+4 semitones)

Each hexagon cell represents **one note**. The pieces are **tetrahexes** (4 hexagons joined edge-to-edge), meaning each piece represents a **4-note chord**. 

Rotating a piece 60° cycles the internal intervals along the Tonnetz axes, re-voicing the chord in real-time. For example, rotating a straight "I" piece changes it between:
*   `C-G-D-A` (fifths: suspended, open)
*   `C-E-G#-C` (major thirds: augmented)
*   `C-Eb-F#-A` (minor thirds: diminished)

## Game Modes

### 1. Chop Mode (Infinite Sandbox)
Select any piece from the palette or keyboard letters, position and rotate it freely, and place it anywhere on an infinite scrolling grid. Clicking a placed piece picks it back up. Panning is supported by dragging empty space.

### 2. Puzzle Mode (Hex Bounded Board)
A strategic mode on a radius-5 hexagonal board. You are fed random pieces from a queue to fit into the grid. Completing a full axis-line of cells clears them. Game over occurs when no further pieces can be placed.

### 3. Gravity Mode (Falling Cup Block Mode)
A fast-paced falling block mode inside a 10x15 cup-shaped board:
*   **Falling Physics:** Pieces spawn at row 20 and drop down. On a hex grid, vertical paths alternate down-left and down-right steps to maintain columns.
*   **Rigid Piece Sliding:** If the vertical path is blocked, the active piece slides diagonally down as a single rigid body if there is a slope valley available.
*   **Vertical Shifting Clears:** Completing a horizontal row of fifths clears the line and shifts all cells above it straight down, maintaining column structures.
*   **Speed Escalation:** Gravity starts slow (1000ms steps) and gets 50ms faster for each cleared line (clamped to a 100ms limit).
