/**
 * STORY TESTS
 *
 * Unlike mobile.spec.js/desktop.spec.js/invariants.spec.js, which each verify one narrow
 * mechanism (often by reaching directly into SandboxMode.state/GravityMode.state to set up a
 * scenario quickly), these drive a full, realistic play session through real interaction only —
 * clicking the actual controls a player would click, never assigning game state directly. The
 * point is to catch bugs that only show up across a *sequence* of actions, not in any one of
 * them in isolation (e.g. a control that's perfectly reachable but does the wrong thing when
 * pressed — spatial-reachability checks like INV-13 can't catch that; only actually pressing it
 * and checking the outcome can).
 *
 * Each story here is built from a REAL captured session (js/replay.js's window.replay(), filed
 * live via the bug-report link — see github.com/gregory-marton/Tonncade/issues/1), not a
 * hand-written or purpose-built move sequence. An earlier version of this file drove a story
 * with every next piece forced to 'O' via GravityMode.randomPiece() overridden directly, which
 * was rightly called out live as "wildly unfaithful": it didn't test the code that actually
 * gives players pieces, it replaced it.
 *
 * Two things make a replay actually faithful, both learned the hard way while building this:
 *
 * 1. Seed via the `?seed=` URL param, NOT page.addInitScript(). js/replay.js's own Replay.init()
 *    runs at App.init() and calls seedRandom() unconditionally, which overwrites Math.random()
 *    again with fresh entropy unless it finds ?seed= in the URL -- an addInitScript-set seed
 *    gets silently clobbered on every load. This was confirmed the hard way: the exact same
 *    replay produced a different outcome on every run (cell counts of 28, 32, 36, 44...) until
 *    switching to ?seed= made it land on the identical real outcome every single time.
 * 2. Resolve each tap to its real target cell via document.elementFromPoint() + the cell's own
 *    data-p/data-q (exactly what the app itself reads in its click handler), then use
 *    Playwright's own .click() on that element -- rather than replaying raw coordinates via
 *    manual mouse.move()/down()/up(), which is both less robust and no more faithful (the
 *    coordinates only ever mattered as a way to name which cell was tapped).
 *
 * The only liberties taken from the real recorded events: dropping the leading `resize` (the
 * viewport is set directly instead) and the trailing `#report-bug-link` click (reporting the
 * session isn't part of playing it).
