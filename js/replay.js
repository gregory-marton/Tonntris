/**
 * replay.js - Always-on input recording for post-hoc bug reports and full session recreation.
 *
 * Keeps a rolling log of the last MAX_EVENTS raw events (keydown, pointer down/up, and viewport
 * resize/orientation changes) from page load, independent of the current mode. Modes routinely
 * reassign window.onkeydown per mode switch (App.setMode nulls it, each mode's setupEvents()
 * reassigns it) -- this listens via addEventListener instead, so it keeps recording across every
 * mode change without needing any mode to cooperate.
 *
 * Keystrokes and taps alone aren't enough to actually recreate a session: every mode that draws
 * random pieces (Gravity, Blast) depends on Math.random(), and without knowing what it produced,
 * replaying the same inputs against a fresh (differently-random) session won't reproduce
 * anything. So this seeds Math.random() once per page load, from real entropy (via
 * crypto.getRandomValues -- gameplay is exactly as unpredictable to the player as before, only
 * now the specific sequence any one session got is reproducible after the fact), and records
 * that seed. Pointer coordinates are similarly meaningless without knowing the viewport size and
 * orientation they were captured at, which can change mid-session on mobile -- recorded at load
 * and on every resize.
 *
 * A player who hits a bug can open the browser console and type copy(replay()) to get their
 * seed, viewport history, and last few thousand real inputs as JSON, without having to reproduce
 * the issue with any special instrumentation pre-armed -- the recording was already running.
